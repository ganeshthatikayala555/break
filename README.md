# break

here,for main method a stackframe is pushed into callstack

here only one method(main)  ,so there will be a single stackframe in callstack
break is used for efficient processing of data which saves processing time of data,
when there is too much data ,when we want to find a  specific element by iterating through
them,we can process only few of them and find out our element
